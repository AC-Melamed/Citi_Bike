# Citi_Bike

## Overview
This project includes a Tableau data story analyzing a dataset of user data collected by the bike ridesharing company "CitiBike" from its userbase in Manhattan island, NYC.  To prepare it for analysis, the dataset was first loaded into Python 3 using Pandas so that a datetime format could be applied, and then imported into Tableau, where a series of visualizations were generated, arranged into Dashboards, and then annotated with brief anlyses as part of a [Data Story](https://public.tableau.com/views/CitiBike_Analysis_DataStory/CitiBikeDataStory?:language=en-US&publish=yes&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link).

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to provide a hypothetical investor considering helping CitiBike to expand their operations in another city with useful and engaging insights into the existing userbase in Manhattan.
